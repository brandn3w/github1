    <h1>The Fawn</h1>
    <h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
            <p>There it was I saw what I shall never forget<br>
            And never retrieve.<br>
            Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to<br>
            believe,<br>
            He lay, yet there he lay,<br>
            Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft<br>
            small ebony hoves,<br>
            The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.</p><br>
            
            <p>Surely his mother had never said, "Lie here<br>
            Till I return," so spotty and plain to see<br>
            On the green moss lay he.<br>
            His eyes had opened; he considered me.</p><br>
            
           <p> I would have given more than I care to say<br>
            To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend<br>
            One moment only of that forest day:</p><br>
            
            
           <p> Might I have had the acceptance, not the love<br>
            Of those clear eyes;<br>
            Might I have been for him in the bough above<br>
            Or the root beneath his forest bed,<br>
            A part of the forest, seen without surprise.</p><br>
            
            <p>Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he<br>
            depart<br>
            That jerked him to his jointy knees,<br>
            And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling<br>
            On his new legs, between the stems of the white<br>
            trees?</p><br>
