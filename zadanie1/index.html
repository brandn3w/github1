    <h1>The Fawn</h1>
    <h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
    <p>There it was I saw what I shall never forget
            And never retrieve.
            Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to
            believe,
            He lay, yet there he lay,
            Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft
            small ebony hoves,
            The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.</p>
            
            <p>Surely his mother had never said, "Lie here
            Till I return," so spotty and plain to see
            On the green moss lay he.
            His eyes had opened; he considered me.</p>
            
           <p>/p> I would have given more than I care to say
            To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend
            One moment only of that forest day:</p>
            
            
           <p>/p> Might I have had the acceptance, not the love
            Of those clear eyes;
            Might I have been for him in the bough above
            Or the root beneath his forest bed,
            A part of the forest, seen without surprise.</p>
            
            <p>/p>Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he
            depart
            That jerked him to his jointy knees,
            And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling
            On his new legs, between the stems of the white
            trees?</p>
